# Code-Play
An e-learning platform for users to interactively learn the programming language TypeScript. The main difference from most other programming language learning sites is that Code&Play has an interactive story that accompanies the learning process. A text-based story is present in each level, and the user progresses through each level by completing a challenge that involves coding in TypeScript, generally a particular feature of the language (like variable declaration), and ties with the story itself. This way, learning becomes more enjoyable and engaging. Built using server-side Python, client-side Javascript (ReactJS), Google App Engine and Google Cloud SQL.
